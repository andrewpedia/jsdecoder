GTest-based Unit Tests

This directory contains GTest-based unit tests for NSS.

Currently, these are only loopback-type tests of libsssl,
but could be expanded to other types of tests. To make these
work do:

- Set NSS_BUILD_GTESTS=1 before starting your build

- cd tests/

- Set NSS_TESTS=ssl_gtests and NSS_CYCLES=standard

- run ./all.sh

This will run the certutil tests (generating a test db) and
will finalize with a call to the ssl_gtest

You should be able to run the unit tests manually as:

  ssl_gtest -d ${SSLGTESTDIR}

Where $SSLGTESTDIR the directory created by ./all.sh or a manually
created directory with a database containing a certificate called
server (with its private keys)


There is a very trivial set of tests that demonstrate some
of the features.
