/**
 * This class represents a single touch block. A touch block is
 * a set of touch events that can be cancelled by web content via
 * touch event listeners.
 *
 * Every touch-start event creates a new touch block. In this case, the
 * touch block consists of the touch-start, followed by all touch events
 * up to but not including the next touch-start (except in the case where
 * a long-tap happens, see below). Note that in particular we cannot know
 * when a touch block ends until the next one is started. Most touch
 * blocks are created by receipt of a touch-start event.
 *
 * Every long-tap event also creates a new touch block, since it can also
 * be consumed by web content. In this case, when the long-tap event is
 * dispatched to web content, a new touch block is started to hold the remaining
 * touch events, up to but not including the next touch start (or long-tap).
 *
 * Conceptually, each touch block can be cancelled by web content, and
 * this information is stored in the mPreventDefault flag. Because web
 * content runs on the Gecko main thread, we cannot always wait for web content's
 * response. Instead, there is a timeout that sets this flag in the case
 * where web content doesn't respond in time. The mContentResponded
 * and mContentResponseTimerExpired flags indicate which of these scenarios
 * occurred.
 *
 * Additionally, if touch-action is enabled, each touch block should
 * have a set of allowed touch behavior flags; one for each touch point.
 * This also requires running code on the Gecko main thread, and so may
 * be populated with some latency. The mAllowedTouchBehaviorSet and
 * mAllowedTouchBehaviors variables track this information.
